        <p id="description">
          Once upon a time, King Unnamed of Nowhereland was both smiling and
          crying at the same time. He was smiling because his enormous brand-new
          palace with many spacious rooms and corridors has just been finished.
          He is also crying as these rooms need to be illuminated and kept warm,
          but the ongoing increase of utility costs affect him as well. So now
          it's time to think about the placement of the palace's light bulbs. We
          need to place them so that everything is properly lit, but we cannot
          install any unnecessary bulbs.
